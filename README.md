GPA-CGPA-CALCULATOR FOR 2017R IT DEPARTMENT

Students sometime feel difficult and bit confused in calculating GPA and CGPA for each semester. So I created this application for their ease calculations. This can also be used via offline.

I have uploaded few files only.

To calculate CGPA, students should add their total marks obtained in all the semesters in a particular subject.
Students should divide the obtained marks with the number of classes attended by the student i.e. with the credit hours.
Student, after taking out the CGPA of each subject, students must add the numbers which will conclude and show the final CGPA obtained by a student in a course or in a class.
